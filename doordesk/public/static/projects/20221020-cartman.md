Title: Cartman is public!
Date: 2022 10 20

[Cartman](https://old.doordesk.net/cartman) is trained by combining Microsoft's
[DialoGPT-medium](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium)
NLP model (GPT2 model trained on 147M samples of multi-turn dialogue from Reddit) with 17 seasons of
[South Park](https://southparkstudios.com)
transcripts.

Requests are routed from
[Nginx](https://nginx.com)
through
[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com)
to a
[Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-4-8gb-tested) running
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com),
and the Cartman model using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
It has enough RAM for more, but the CPU is pretty much at its limit. Expect it to take a few
seconds, I'm cheap. Sorry(kinda).

You can download a Docker image if you'd like to run it on your own hardware for either
[x86_64](https://old.doordesk.net/files/chatbots_api_x86_64.tar.gz)
or
[aarch64](https://old.doordesk.net/files/chatbots_api_aarch64.tar.gz).

More info [here](https://github.com/adoyle0/cartman) as well as
[example scripts](https://github.com/adoyle0/cartman/tree/master/api/test)
to talk to the docker container.
