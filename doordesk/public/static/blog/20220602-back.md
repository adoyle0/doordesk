### Where the hell have I been!?

Looking back at the past 5 weeks, it's impressive the amount of new things that have
been shoved in my face. A list I'll try to make contains:

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev)
- [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)
- Plus the math and background to go with it all!

It doesn't seem like much at the time except chaos, but then about a week later it
finally sets in. After tomorrow we'll be halfway through the course and while I guess
you could say that it's half over, or that it signifies progress, I feel it's more like
being halfway up Mount Everest and looking&mdash;trying to squint through the clouds and
make out what looks like the peak. I don't see a peak and maybe it's because I'm
nearsighted but I can also tell you that if were to look down then I can't see where
I've started either!

It's been quite a ride and I hope to see it to the end. I don't have time to even think
about it further. It's where I perform my best though, on my heels. Probably by
design...

### After?

I would like to use these skills to expand on some of the class projects I've worked on
and I have some other ideas using language processing I think would be fun to play with.
I think it would be fun to create an internet chat bot, we'll start with text but if
speech recognition is practical then I may add and play with that too. I would also like
to make some sort of "Propaganda Detector"
