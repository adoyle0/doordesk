    <h3>Where the hell have I been!?</h3>
    <p>
        Looking back at the past 5 weeks, it's impressive the amount of new things that have
        been shoved in my face. A list I'll try to make contains:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/">Statsmodels</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">Scikit-Learn</a></li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/praw-dev/praw">PRAW</a></li>
        <li>Plus the math and background to go with it all!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It doesn't seem like much at the time except chaos, but then about a week later it
        finally sets in. After tomorrow we'll be halfway through the course and while I guess
        you could say that it's half over, or that it signifies progress, I feel it's more like
        being halfway up Mount Everest and looking&mdash;trying to squint through the clouds and
        make out what looks like the peak. I don't see a peak and maybe it's because I'm
        nearsighted but I can also tell you that if were to look down then I can't see where
        I've started either!
    </p>
    <p>
        It's been quite a ride and I hope to see it to the end. I don't have time to even think
        about it further. It's where I perform my best though, on my heels. Probably by
        design...
    </p>
    <h3>After?</h3>
    <p>
        I would like to use these skills to expand on some of the class projects I've worked on
        and I have some other ideas using language processing I think would be fun to play with.
        I think it would be fun to create an internet chat bot, we'll start with text but if
        speech recognition is practical then I may add and play with that too. I would also like
        to make some sort of "Propaganda Detector"
