    <h2 className="title">It's about time, NVIDIA</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's about time... NVIDIA has finally released and is starting to
        support Open-source software with their new modules released recently for the Linux
        kernel. NVIDIA historically has been seemingly against Linux/OSS for whatever reason.
        This is a huge step forward both for end users and NVIDIA.
