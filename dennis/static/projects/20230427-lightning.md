Title: Lightning
Date: 2023 4 27

[Lightning](https://lightning.doordesk.net) is a mapping/data vis project for finding
EV charging stations. It uses [Martin](https://github.com/maplibre/martin) to serve
tiles generated from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data to a 
    [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) frontend. Additional layers are added on top
via [Deck.gl](https://deck.gl) using data from [EVChargerFinder](https://github.com/kevin-fwu/EVChargerFinder) made by my friend
Kevin.
