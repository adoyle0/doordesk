A file gets put in a directory, then based on the filetype and location it gets automatically 
indexed by the backend then displayed on the frontend with React.

Idea is to just throw files at it and it'll just be handled, cause I'm lazy.

Home - Interleave latest from other pages, maybe add top/hot lists or something
Blog - Blog, display latest posts, summarize these until clicked? 
Projects - Same as blog but may have pins at the top with cards
Games - Cards with thumbnails and summaries, pins/popular
Cartman, Enigma - Own pages? Pinned projects?

- Animations to make it purdy
- Post rank system
- Dynamic backgrounds/colors? How to animate?
