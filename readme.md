A file (html/md with header, wasm binary, jupyter notebook?) gets put in a directory, then simply exists on the website.

I just want to throw files at it and have it be handled, cause I'm lazy.

Home - Interleave latest from other pages, maybe add top/hot lists or something

Blog - Blog, display latest posts, summarize these until clicked? 

Projects - Same as blog but may have pins at the top with cards

Games - Cards with thumbnails and summaries, pins/popular

Cartman, Enigma - Own pages? Pinned projects?

- Animations to make it purdy
- Post rank system
- Dynamic backgrounds/colors? How to animate?
